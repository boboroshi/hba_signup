Band Signup

This app was created to have a simple computerized signup for fans at a show running on a beat up laptop. Drunk people have the worst handwriting in the world, and this reduces the input time to get something into a mailing list, etc. 

Long term, hook it up to a sweet ass pipe to the mailing list itself.
